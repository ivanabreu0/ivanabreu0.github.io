      <p>Hello everyone! My name is Ivan Abreu and I am a rising sophmore at the University of Rhode Island. I'm a physics major as well<br>
        considering taking on a cs minor. I am taking the CSC 106 class to work on learning more CS languages as well as using it as a prerequisite.
        <br>Originally from the Dominican Republic, I'm from Cranston, Rhode Island where I attended high school there. During high school I found <br>
        started some of my favorite hobbies, namely computers and swimming. In terms of computers, I've built a lot of them, enough to be known as the <br>
        computer whiz by my friends and family. Swimming has also been a huge part of my life. While it certainly is hard, I can't help having fun with it. <br>
        All of my swim team's hard work and extensive practices (We had a very hard coach) resulted in us winning the D2 championships my Junior year, <br>
        an achievement I'm still very proud of to this day. With this little piece of information, I hope you've learnt a bit more about me (I also love <br>
        black coffee) and my journey here at URI. <br>
