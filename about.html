      <p>In this page you can find much of my portfolio. Here I have (and will continue to add more) of my Javascript<br>
        works done in my URI CSC 106 class. Feel free to take a look at any one of these works, as more and more will be on the way.
        <br>Here you can also find links to oter connected pages in my portfolio, giving you quick access to my Home and About Me pages.<br>
        Hopefully these projects can show you and other visitors how fun, productive, and useful coding can be!</p>
