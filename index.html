      <h1>Welcome To My Coding Page!</h1>
      
      <p>Welcome to my CSC 106 page! Here I will have links to other connected pages regarding my portfolio. Through these links,<br>
        you'll be able to learn more about me,my coding assignments on JavaScript, or just be able to come back to this page and 
        <br>stare at it a little longer.This site as well as all the other were made using my own HTML and CSS code, <br>
        as well as some images made in PIXLR. Despite acting as just an intro page for my programming portfolio, 
        <br>I hope you'll enjoy your stay here and be able to lean a little more about coding as well as myself.</p>
