      <h1>Welcome To My Coding Page!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my CSC 106 page!<br>Here I will have links to other connected pages regarding my portfolio. 
        Through these links, you'll be able to learn more about me,
        <br>my coding assignments on JavaScript, or just be able to come back to this page and stare at it a little longer.<br>
        Despite acting as just an intro page for my programming portfolio, I hope you'll enjoy your stay here and be able to lean a<br>
        little more about coding as well as myself.</p>
